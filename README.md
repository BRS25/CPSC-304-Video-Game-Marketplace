# CPSC-304-Video-Game-Marketplace

Our project is a video game buy/sell database containing information about users
and details about the items they are selling or buying.  Functionality is split
among multiple pages.  Initially, there is a login page where existing users can 
login or new users can sign up for an account.  Depending on the user's status,
(regular or admin), they will be redirected to the appropriate pages.  Regular
users will be able to edit their profile information, create new buy/sell listings,
and search for active and inactive posts that match ther user's criteria.  Admins will
be able to delete posts and to update a user's rating.
